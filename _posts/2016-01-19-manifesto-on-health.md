Hey Folks!

This is my personal site, where I plan to share photos, research, general goings-on and whatever else is fitness, or health related and interesting.  I'm curious to see how the AI on this platform creates my site for me and presents the info!  This will hopefully be an easy thing to work with so I can create and develop more and new info on an ongoing basis.  As always, my views of health and fitness are as follows:

Your body will always and _only_ respond to the stimulus you provide it with.  

It's a fairly straight forward view of health, but I find it's usually overlooked as we tend to search for quick fixes, "5 minute abs", or the "7 things you aren't eating that solves all of life problems!  Number 4 will blow your mind!"  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a7facc30-3370-4043-95aa-8e3b76b75446.JPG)

I think the unsexy-ness of being responsible for your own health is the main reason most people aren't blown away by my saying it.  That and they don't _want_ it to be true.  

From there, we can look more closely into how to best affect change for our physiology, as the genes we were dealt at birth DO have an affect on our health - but we need to keep in mind, we can't change those genes - only the way they are expressed.  So there is a certain amount of nature present in the nature/nurture debate for health.  But seeing as your genes can't change, and your behaviour and beliefs can, we should devote our energy to the nurture side of the equation in order to express our best self (through our DNA, of course). ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3e4d8181-5ba8-4432-b99a-5e528e3f224a.JPG)

My goal is to be the person that helps guide people through the myriad of misleading, and unimportant information that exists out there, and to develop simple, easy to take action on items that have the ability to produce profound changes on their individual physiology.  

I'll leave this here as a "manifesto on health", for both myself and you all to read.  Hope it's helpful!

Stay Healthy friends!
