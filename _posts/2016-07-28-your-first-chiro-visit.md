So you've decided to see a chiropractor... 

Good choice! You're going to need to keep a few things in mind. Pain is not a good thing to focus on. For your own psychological health, but also because pain is not an objective experience. We all experience it differently and in some cases, NOT feeling pain is worse than feeling it. If you got stabbed and it DIDN'T hurt, we'd probbaly have to check you for some sort of super power first, but after that, we'd probably be concerned that something was wrong with your nervous system. In that case, the return of pain would be a good (?) thing. Totally counter productive. 

So what IS pain good for then? 

Pain is an alarm. It is the worst, most annoying alarm you've ever "heard". You experience it because it is your bodies way of telling you, "dude... something is wrong". So you may have pain because you tore your rotator cuff muscle, and moving your shoulder more could damage or tear it further. Pain is helping you by limiting your range of motion so as to reduce further injury until you're looked at by a professional. You might feel great, and then when your chiropractor starts pressing into some unused areas of your spine, you start feeling some "discomfort". Those unused joints are breaking down. They're laying down scar tissue, and while the process isn't inherently painful DURING, it will inevitably lead to chronic back, neck, shoulder, hip, knee, ankle and wrist pain. It'll lead to increased baseline pain levels because you're now missing mechanoreception through your tissues and joints. You are LESS capable than you previously were. That process of joint breakdown only takes 2 days of joint immobility to begin. Without daily, symmetrical, full range of motion, against resistance use of a joint, it will begin to break down. Consider it flossing your teeth, but for your joints. 

So when your Chiro presses through that immobile joint, you feel tenderness or a little (or sometimes a lot) of discomfort. That is an area that needs to be addressed. Your chiro will use any number of approaches or techniques to restore motion to that joint or tissue, and you will be healthier for having had that done. You _may feel more tenderness for the next day or two. _Do not be alarmed by that as you've broken down scar tissue and the joint/connective tissue is repairing itself. This remodelling process takes a long time (1-2 years), which is why your Chiro wants to see you with some regularity. The more you do for yourself (the daily, symmetrical, full, resisted range of motion we mentioned above), the more you'll feel and see the benefits of Chiropractic care. 

Your Chiropractor should be working in concert with other professionals if need be. Doctors, Physios, athletic therapists, massage therapists, personal trainers/coaches, etc. A team effort is better, when everyone knows the goal and works together to achieve it. Adjusting your spine doesn't replace addressing the tissues in your knee or shoulder, it doesn't replace fascial work to help your tissues glide better, it doesn't replace pain relief that helps you sleep, or technique or precision work for your sport. It supports those goals. You can't approach those goals as well if your spine isn't functioning at full capacity. 

Let me know if you have any questions about the above, I'm always available to answer questions for open minds :)
